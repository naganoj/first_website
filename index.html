	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>I am a teacher at Western Reserve Academy.  I teach computer science classes.  My students build their technical and problem-solving skills in my classes.</p>
	<p>One course that I teach is Computer Science 1.  In this course, students learn web development skills and become familiar and proficient with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
	<p>When I am not teaching classes, I spend most of my time with my two daughters: Melanie, age 8, and Grace, age 6.  They like going swimming, playing games, and reading.</p>

	<h3>Western Reserve Academy</h3>
	<p><a href="https://www.wra.net/">Western Reserve Academy</a> is a residential high school located in Hudson, Ohio.</p>
	<p>This year, it was ranked #1 Private School in Ohio by Niche.</p>
	<p>I love teaching at Western Reserve Academy because the students are fun, kind, hard-working, and talented.  My colleagues are terrific, and the campus is beautiful.<p>
